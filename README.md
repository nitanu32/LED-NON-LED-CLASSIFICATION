# LED/NON-LED CLASSIFICATION

Project was completed at Redaptive Inc., under the guidance of Chester Hitz. As a Data Science Intern, I:
- Researched the correlation between various energy consumption indicators (active power, aggregated power factor, mean & median power factor) and LED vs non-LED light circuits through exploratory data analysis
- Built k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest classifiers with support of manager
- Created confusion matrices to determine accuracy of classifiers against energy consumption & light circuit data

Results will be used to hone in on Redaptive's data collection priorities, as well as serve as a foundation for advancing their data software roadmap.
